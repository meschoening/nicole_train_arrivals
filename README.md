# nicole_train_arrivals
Python program to show train arrivals for any line, station, and direction combo for the WMATA metro system. Made with &lt;3 for Nicole.

# Program Outline & Fun Facts
- main_display.py contains code for the interface.
- MetroAPI.py interfaces with the official WMATA API to download data.
- data_handler.py caches API data while the program is open. Helps reduce lag when switching windows and changing settings.
- config_handler.py saves selected settings in a file for retrieval every time the app opens.
- usage.py sums the price of my AI-assisted coding usage throughout the project. Just for fun, because it was all done on a free trial!
